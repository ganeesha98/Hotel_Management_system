# CSPRG-Hotel_Management_System
<h2>Project Overveiw</h2>
From a guest-facing perspective, your hotel front desk is the brains of the operation.
Any question a guest has about any aspect of your hotel, they are going to come to the hotel front desk to get answered. 
Itâ€™s immediately obvious how having a hotel front desk system that ties in with all of your other systems is crucial to an efficient workflow.<br>

Rather than having to call different departments or switch between different software programs to get answers for guests and help them achieve their goals, 
your staff will be able to quickly access everything from one location.
Whether your guest wants to book an appointment at the spa or be reminded of which room they are in, it can all be handled from one software package.<br>
